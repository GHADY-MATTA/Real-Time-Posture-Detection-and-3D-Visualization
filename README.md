🎯 Real-Time Posture Detection and 3D Visualization Using MPU6050 + Processing
Project Summary:

I developed a complete real-time system that captures 3D motion data from an MPU6050 sensor connected to an Arduino, processes the quaternion data using onboard DMP (Digital Motion Processor), and visualizes the user’s orientation in 3D using Processing with the Toxiclibs graphics library.

On the Processing side, the system receives serialized quaternion packets over USB, decodes the data into 3D rotational vectors, and renders a dynamically animated 3D model (including fuselage, wings, and directional fins). Additionally, the model performs real-time posture analysis, displaying a “Healthy” or “Unhealthy” status based on specific axis thresholds derived from the sensor data.

🔍 Key Features:
🔗 Serial Communication Integration between Arduino and Processing at 115200 baud

📦 Quaternion Parsing via custom teapot packet decoder (14-byte stream)

🎨 Real-Time 3D Rendering of motion data using OpenGL and Toxiclibs

📏 Axis-Angle Conversion and rotation mapping for live object manipulation

🧍 Posture Analysis Engine: Detects poor posture using predefined Euler/quaternion bounds

🧠 Fail-Safe Communication: Redundant 'r' packet resend ensures sensor reset recovery

📐 Custom Geometry Rendering: Dynamic cylinder drawing, wings, and fin meshes

💡 Live Text Feedback: Quaternion axis values and health status displayed in the viewport
